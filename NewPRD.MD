1. Objective

To implement a personalized, agentic event recommendation system that leverages a user’s historical chat data to provide highly tailored event suggestions based on their preferences and interests.

⸻

2. Background & Motivation

Currently, the web app allows users to manually input their event preferences. To enhance user experience and streamline personalization, we aim to use the user’s chat history as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) source. This will allow the system to automatically understand user preferences and provide more accurate and relevant event recommendations.

	•	Preference Modeling:
Use natural language processing to identify and weigh user preferences, creating a dynamic profile that can be updated with new data.
	•	RAG-Based Recommendation:
Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system that uses the chat history to fine-tune event suggestions based on the user’s input.
	•	User Interface Update:
Modify the existing AI Instructions box to allow for both free-form input and automatic preference loading from the user’s profile.
	•	Privacy and Consent:
Ensure all data usage is transparent and that users can opt in or out of using their chat history at any time.
